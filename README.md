# HANDWRITTEN-TEXT-EXTRACTION
Extracts the text from the handwritten document and save in an docs format for tenslating and editing the extracted text.

PROJECT PURPOSE:

Despite the abundances of technological writing tools,many people still choose to take their notes traditionally with pon and paper. However, there are drawbacks to handwriting text. It's difficult to store and access physical documents in an efficient manner, search through them efficiently and to share them with others. The aim of this project is to further explore the task of classifying handwritten text and to convert handwritten text into the digital format. Handwritten text is a very general term and we wanted to narrow down the scope of the project byspecifying the meaning of handwritten text for our purposes. In this project, we took on the challenge of classifying the image of any handwritten word, which might be of the form of cursive or black writing and convert it into editable text and also to other languages.

INSPIRATION:

Our main inspiration is Doctor's Handwriting and the judgement of the judges which is very difficult to understand. The OCR will help us to identify those handwritten words and convert it into normal text.

TECH STACK:

1.PRE-PROCESSING Extract the text from the image and process it

SEGMENTATION The words are segmented into individual letters using OCR

FEATURE EXTRACTION The major goal of feature extraction is to extract a set of features, which maximizes the recognition rate elements.

CLASSIFICATION This is the decision making stage of recognition system. The classifier contains two hidden layers, using a log sigmoid activation function to train the algorithm.

The project is done with the association of my other three  collgemates such as Deva Prasath R,Dhanush Karthik K R,Rohin S.
